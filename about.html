                <h1>About Rita</h1>
                <p>Hi there! Rita is a senior at James Madison Unviersity in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She is studying Interactive Design in the School of Media Arts and Design and is minoring in Art. She is passionate about design and helping people and wants a career in User Experience Design because she feels it is a great middle ground for both. Over the summer, Rita was a Development intern for Switchboard Inc. in Washington D.C. and got to help design mockups for features within their product and conduct user testing to test new features. Rita also works at JMU's student run newspaper, The Breeze, and was a Design Intern at the Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project. Rita is also involved with JMU's major and gender inclusive honor fraternity, Phi Sigma Pi. She was the Public Relations Chair in the JMU chapter where she designs and orders merchandise, ran the Phi Sigma Pi instagram account, updates the organization's profile on the Be Involved website, and photographs events that the organization holds. Next semester she will be the Recruitment Chair and get to organize the recruitment that brings in new members. Rita is the recipient of the SMAD Alumni/Professional Advisory Council Scholarship Award for the Spring of 2020 and also received her Girl Scout Gold and Silver Trefoil Awards in 2018. In her free time, Rita likes to care for her plants, spend time with her cat, make time for friends and family, paint, crochet, and read.</p>
