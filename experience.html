                <p>Rita worked as a Design Intern at the Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project, a historical center in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She is worked on the Roots Run Deep project within the organization in which the goal is to create a vitual walking tour of notable historical sites where the black community in Harrisonburg have had successful businesses, schools, communities, and more. Rita helped with the design needs for the project including building a Weebly website, designing the logo for the project, and designing a brochure booklet. She worked with grad student, Lauren Oakes, who came up with the idea for this project and made the tour become a reality. She also has been helping find ways to get the word out about the project to both the Harrisonburg and JMU community, such as reaching out to The Breeze to do include a story about it in the newspaper. Rita started her internship back in September 2020 and finished in May 2021.</p>
